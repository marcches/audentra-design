/**
 * A card that floats: the anchored panel a control opens.
 *
 * It was `app/TopbarPopover.jsx` — one component for the bell and the points
 * chip, so the two could not drift apart on `Esc`, on focus return and on the
 * scrim — and it did that job. What it did not do was say what the *panel* is.
 * Its shell (`.pop-panel`, `.pop-head`, `.pop-foot`, `.pop-state`) was a
 * second set of rules, typed by hand in `housing.css`, on no styleguide, and
 * what went inside was whatever each feature drew from memory. That is why both
 * panels read as a component from somewhere else (Marco, 2026-08-21): they were
 * their own component.
 *
 * So the panel is a `Card`. It carries `section-card`, publishes `--card-pad`
 * and `--card-radius`, and what a feature puts inside it is the card's own three
 * zones — `CardHead`, `CardRows`, `CardFoot` — or the rail's `AnchorCard` taking
 * the top corners, drawn by the rules every block of every page already uses.
 * The popover adds only what floating needs: the position, the layer, the
 * shadow, the scroll, and the sticky head.
 *
 * Not built on `lib/overlay.js`. That primitive is for a dialog that covers the
 * page and traps the keyboard; this is an anchored menu that dismisses on an
 * outside click, exactly like `PreviewStateMenu` two chips along, and it uses
 * the same `--z-popover-scrim` / `--z-popover` pair so the three things that
 * corner can open can never appear on top of one another.
 *
 * `align` is which edge of the trigger the panel hangs from: `end` (the
 * default — the topbar's controls sit at the window's right edge) or `start`.
