/**
 * The middle rung of the feedback ladder.
 *
 *   in place   the control that caused it says what happened — `Button pending`,
 *              `Field error`, the row that changed under your hand
 *   toast      something happened, and you were not looking at the place it
 *              happened. This file.
 *   blocking   you cannot continue without deciding — `InfoModal`, `PageError`
 *
 * What this owns, and what the twenty hand-written `setToast(string)` callers
 * never had:
 *
 *   - three tones, and `critical` is not merely a red one: it takes
 *     `role="alert"` and it does not disappear on its own;
 *   - a duration derived from the sentence rather than a constant, paused while
 *     the pointer or the keyboard is on it — without the pause, a toast with an
 *     action is an action you have to catch;
 *   - at most one action, because a second action is a decision and a decision
 *     is a modal;
 *   - a stack of three, so the second message stops deleting the first.
 *
 * The timer is JavaScript and not a CSS animation, deliberately. This repo has
 * twice had a rule change what it did by being moved between files; a timer
 * that lives in the stylesheet is a dismissal that a media query can cancel.
 * The bar across the top is only the picture of the timer, never the timer.
