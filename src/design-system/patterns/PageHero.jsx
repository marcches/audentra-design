/**
 * The band a page opens with — the one saturated surface in the product.
 *
 * It was the first thing `PageShell` rendered and nothing else could render
 * it, so the one screen that is not a section — onboarding, which replaces the
 * chrome — grew a head of its own: an eyebrow, an `h1` and a lede on the bare
 * canvas, with the demo control and the way out floating above them (Marco,
 * 2026-08-21: "tá tudo inconsistente aqui"). The band is now its own pattern
 * and `PageShell` composes it, so a flow opens the way a section does: the
 * eyebrow in mono, the title, the lede, the motif in the right edge.
 *
 *   flag      the green word before the kicker — "Offer accepted"
 *   kicker    the eyebrow's text — who owns this record, as of when; or, in a
 *             flow, the position: "Step 3 of 8"
 *   title     the sentence
 *   lede      one or two lines under it; always rendered, even empty, so the
 *             band is the same height on every route (`--hero-min`)
 *   motif     the section's icon in the orbit, outline on purpose — a two-tone
 *             glyph's back layer turns to mud on a gradient disc
 *   focusable the title takes focus when a flow moves to its next question,
 *             so a keyboard user is moved to it instead of left at the foot of
 *             the last one; the ref is the `h1`
