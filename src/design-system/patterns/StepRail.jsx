/**
 * The rail a multi-step flow is walked along — the institution, the figure,
 * the steps in four states, the human at the foot, the vendor under it.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in the section that needed it first, because the
 * four states are a *decision about the product*, not about onboarding: a step
 * that was set aside must look the same wherever a flow has steps, and the
 * moment a second flow copies these classes by hand they will drift. This is
 * the same fix `Drawer` was: seven hand-typed copies of one shell.
 *
 * It knows no domain. The caller supplies the words, the institution's mark
 * and a `state` per row; this owns what each state *looks like* and what it is
 * called:
 *
 *   saved       a green disc with a check. Green means one thing in this
 *               product — covered, satisfied, done — and this is that thing.
 *   current     the product's one gradient, the step's number on it. The only
 *               saturated mark, because it is the only one still happening.
 *   skipped     a sunk disc with the half-filled circle on it. **Not amber** —
 *               amber means someone still has to act, and inside a flow the
 *               student is walking that is a nag. Not dimmed, not crossed out,
 *               not crimson: each of those reads as failure, and a step set
 *               aside is not a failed step.
 *   upcoming    a hollow ring with the number in it, quiet.
 *
 * `locked` and `unknown` are deliberately **not** a fifth and sixth state. A
 * locked step is an upcoming step that states why it is not open yet; an
 * unknown one is what the rail says when the record could not be read, instead
 * of guessing. Both are drawn as upcoming, with a mark and a sentence.
 *
 * Saved and skipped rows are buttons. Upcoming and locked rows are not, and are
 * not *disabled* buttons either: a disabled control is an offer withdrawn, and
 * no control is a stage that has not arrived.
 *
 * Below 1060 the rail is the compact header — the institution on the left,
 * the count and a short meter on the right — and the rows fold behind a
 * disclosure, so folding the rail never costs the position.
 *
 * Until 2026-08-21 it was the product's purple band turned on its side. The
 * approved surface reads a flow as a light workspace with one saturated thing
 * on it, the primary button; so the rail became paper and the colour moved to
 * the marks.
