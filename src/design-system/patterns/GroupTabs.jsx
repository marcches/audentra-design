/**
 * The leaf switcher for a navigation group — one row, one look, wherever a group
 * has more than one page. My Financials had `.section-tabs` and My Campus Life
 * had `.campus-tabs`; they did the same job in two shapes and two colours, which
 * is exactly the drift the Jam of 2026-08-20 asked us to stop.
 *
 * Labels and routes come from `navigation.js`, so a page cannot be called one
 * thing here and another in the sidebar (ENR-174 AC4).
 *
 * It sits directly above the content it switches. Anything true of the whole
 * group — the balance, a required session — belongs above this row, not below.
