/**
 * The door — Part A §12 of the review of 2026-08-21, built 2026-08-22.
 *
 * No route to a person appears before Edward. Where a screen used to offer a
 * direct line to an office, that control now opens Edward **with the question
 * written and not sent**: the student reads it, fixes it if the screen guessed
 * wrong, and sends it herself. A question sent on her behalf is a conversation
 * she did not choose to start; the point is to spare her the typing, not the
 * decision.
 *
 * It is an event rather than a prop because the door has to work from any
 * feature, and `Edward` is mounted once by the shell and owns its own state.
 * Nothing here imports a feature: the caller supplies the question, in the
 * student's voice, naming the specific item (§12.4), and a context — what the
 * composer's chip should say, which office the question is for, and the hint
 * the answer can use.
 *
 *   openEdward({
 *     question: 'Academic Advising hasn’t posted any times. How do I get in touch with them?',
 *     context: { label: 'Appointments · Academic advising', topic: 'academic', office: null, intent: 'advisor', taskId: null },
 *   });
 *
 * The hand-off is the other direction: when Edward's escalation sends her to a
 * page, what she already said travels with her (§6.4: "Whatever you already
 * told Edward goes with it, so you don't start over"). It is written once and
 * read once, by the page that consumes that kind of route.
