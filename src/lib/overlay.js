/**
 * One overlay behaviour, shared — ENR-181.
 *
 * Before this file the portal had four different answers to the same question.
 * `AcademicDrawer` and `CampusDrawer` each carried their own `FOCUSABLE`
 * constant and their own tab trap, subtly different from one another;
 * `TaskDrawer` and `InfoModal` had no trap at all and leaned on a global `Esc`
 * listener in `App.jsx` that closed every overlay at once — so `Esc` on a modal
 * opened from inside a drawer closed the drawer too.
 *
 * What an overlay gets here:
 *
 *   - focus moves into it on mount and back to whatever opened it on unmount;
 *   - `Esc` closes it, and stops there, so a stack unwinds one layer at a time;
 *   - `Tab` is trapped when it is modal, and free when it is not.
 *
 * `modal: false` is a real case, not a shortcut: the Edward window on a desktop
 * is a non-modal dialog, because the student has to keep using the page they
 * are asking about (ENR-175). Non-modal means no trap — trapping the keyboard
 * inside a panel the page is still live behind is the wrong contract.
 *
 * There is no body scroll lock here, deliberately. This repo has never had one,
 * the mobile sheets use `overscroll-behavior: contain` instead, and ENR-175
 * Scenario 5 asks for the page's scroll position to be left exactly alone.

 * @param suspended      something sits on top of this overlay: it owns `Esc`
 *                       and the trap until it closes. Focus return is not run,
 *                       so suspending never steals focus out of the thing above.
 * @param autoFocus      move focus in on mount. Default true.
 * @param returnFocus    hand focus back on unmount. Default true. Edward turns
 *                       it off: its opener is the pill, which is not in the DOM
 *                       while the window is open, so it does the hand-back
 *                       itself once the pill is back.
