/**
 * Where the portal can go — the destination model, completed by ENR-180.
 *
 * Every destination is declared once. The navigation rows, the page hero and the
 * section placeholder all read this file, so a concept cannot end up with two
 * names on two screens — ENR-174 AC4 as structure rather than as discipline.
 *
 * Started by ENR-166, which declared the rows it builds. ENR-180 extends it with
 * the grouping ENR-174 AC1 requires, the copy each empty section needs and the
 * routing helpers.
 *
 * The page shell pass adds `hero`. Every section opens with the same band — the
 * one My Enrollment has carried since ENR-164 — and its copy lives here rather
 * than inside the page, so a section cannot grow a title that drifts from the
 * name the sidebar gives it. A group owns one hero for all of its leaves: the
 * hero says where you are, the tab row below says which leaf you are reading.
 *
 * `appears` and `produces` are the two halves of the placeholder sentence: what
 * will be here, and what puts it here.
 *
 * `built` says a card owns that screen. Whether it renders is decided by the
 * page registry in `App.jsx` — a destination whose page has not landed yet
 * shows its placeholder, which is its honest state.
 *
 * A destination is a place the navigation can reach. Two things the portal
 * shows are not destinations: My Documents and Accessibility. The Jam of
 * 2026-08-21 took them out of the sidebar and put them under Profile and
 * Health; Marco finished the move the same afternoon — what has no row does not
 * get a page either, it opens the side panel, because that is the portal's one
 * way of opening what lives inside a page. They are declared in `PANELS` below,
 * which carries the copy an `EntryRow` needs and nothing else: no route, no
 * hero, no placeholder, because a panel has no address to land on.

 * address for a student to arrive at before it is built. What it has is the

 * every destination's copy is: a concept must not end up with two names on two
 * screens (ENR-174 AC4).
 *
 * `owner` is the page that holds the door. It is what the panel's drawer label
 * leads with, and it is the reason each of these is under the section it is
 * under: the record is part of what Aster knows about her, and the accommodation
 * question is asked beside the health step it must never be mistaken for
 * (ADR-0003).

 * Neither carries a count. My Enrollment already counts the steps, and any
